# Introduction to Generative AI

Generative AI is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images and other types of content. What makes it a fantastic technology is that it democratizes AI, anyone can use it with as little as a text prompt, a sentence written in a natural language. There's no need for you to learn a language like Python or SQL to accomplish something worthwhile, all you need is to use your language, state what you want and out comes a suggestion from an AI model. The applications and impact for this is huge, you write or understand reports, write applications and much more, all in seconds.

## How did we get Generative AI?

Despite the extraordinary hype created lately by the announcement of generative AI models, this technology is decades in the making, with the first research efforts dating back to 60s. We're now at a point with AI having human cognitive capabilities, like conversation as shown by for example OpenAI ChatGPT or Gemini.

Backing up a bit, the very first prototypes of AI consisted of typewritten chatbots, relying on a knowledge base extracted from a group of experts and represented into a computer. The answers in the knowledge base were triggered by keywords appearing in the input text. However, it soon became clear that such approach, using typewritten chatbots, did not scale well.

### A statistical approach to AI: Machine Learning

A turning point arrived during the 90s, with the application of a statistical approach to text analysis. This led to the development of new algorithms – known with the name of machine learning - able to learn patterns from data, without being explicitly programmed. This approach allows a machine to simulate human language understanding: a statistical model is trained on text-label pairings, enabling the model to classify unknown input text with a pre-defined label representing the intention of the message.

### Neural networks and modern virtual assistants

In more recent times, the technological evolution of the hardware, capable of handling larger amounts of data and more complex computations, encouraged research in the AI fields, leading to the development of advanced machine learning algorithms – called neural networks or deep learning algorithms.

Neural networks (and in particular Recurrent Neural Networks – RNNs) significantly enhanced natural language processing, enabling the representation of the meaning of text in a more meaningful way, valuing the context of a word in a sentence.

This is the technology that powered the virtual assistants born in the first decade of the new century, very proficient in interpreting the human language, identifying a need, and performing an action to satisfy it – like answering with a pre-defined script or consuming a 3rd party service.

### Present day, Generative AI

So that’s how we came to Generative AI today, which can be seen as a subset of deep learning.

After decades of research in the AI field, a new model architecture – called **Transformer** – overcame the limits of RNNs, being able to get much longer sequences of text as input. Transformers are based on the **attention mechanism**, enabling the model to give different weights to the inputs it receives, ‘paying more attention’ where the most relevant information is concentrated, regardless of their order in the text sequence.

Most of the recent generative AI models – also known as Large Language Models (LLMs), since they work with textual inputs and outputs – are indeed based on this architecture. What’s interesting about these models – trained on a huge amount of unlabeled data from diverse sources like books, articles and websites – is that they can be adapted to a wide variety of tasks and generate grammatically correct text with a semblance of creativity. So, not only did they incredibly enhance the capacity of a machine to ‘understand’ an input text, but they enabled their capacity to generate an original response in human language.
